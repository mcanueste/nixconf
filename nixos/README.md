## NixOS Modules

Things that are easier to manage with NixOS are:
- Desktop environments
- Virtualisation related tools (docker/podman/qemu/k3d etc.)
- Gaming
- Kanata for keyboard setup

Other than that, it is also rock solid since the updates are rolling and reproducible.

Everything else is managed from `home-manager` modules.
